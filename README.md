# Prime Real Estate
Prime Real Estate is a fun app born out of an idea I had while walking around the rich streets of San Francisco.

"Wow, these houses must be pretty expensive. I wonder how much they are"

Idea is simple: scan your current location and get an approximate estimate of the average property value.

From there, you can save scans, share them with friends, and revel in how cheap/expensive properties are in certain areas.

## Tech Stack
Prime Real Estate is built using React Native + TypeScript. It uses React hooks for state management and `react-navigation` for mobile navigation.
